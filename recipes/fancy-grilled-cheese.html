    <p>Buttered and toasted crunchy fresh bread filled with melted Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese and delicious Spinach Cannelloni flavours in less than 10 minutes. Spinach and Ricotta Grilled Cheese is the perfect balance of crispy and gooey all in one bite!</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 clove garlic crushed</li>
        <li>⅓ cup ricotta cheese I used reduced-fat</li>
        <li>¼ cup frozen chopped spinach thawed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt and cracked pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dried Italian mixed herbs or Oregano and basil mix</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated light mozzarella cheese or fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 thick slices sourdough bread</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter light or reduced-fat spread</li>
        <li>½ cup of your favourite pasta sauce Passata or Tomato Sauce for U.S readers</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium sized pan/skillet, fry the garlic in a small amount of olive oil (or cooking oil spray), until just fragrant (about 30-60 seconds) over medium-high heat. Remove from heat; add the garlic to a small bowl; set pan/skillet aside.</li>
        <li>Add the ricotta cheese, spinach, parmesan cheese, salt/pepper and Italian herbs to the pan-fried garlic and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Spread one side of each slice of bread with butter. Divide the ricotta mixture in half and spread it on the un-buttered sides of two slices of bread; divide the mozzarella cheese in half and add it over the ricotta mixture; top with remaining bread - buttered side up (to create a sandwich)</li>
        <li>Return the pan/skillet to the stove over medium heat and place the sandwiches in the pan. Cook, turning once, until the cheese has melted and both sides are golden brown (about 3-4 minutes per side).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with extra Italian herbs and serve with the pasta sauce (optional)</li>
    </ol>

    
    <p>Spreading butter on the outer sides of the sandwich is what makes it golden and crunchy. You could also make this in a sandwich press.</p>
